# CDSG_SoC_2016
Welcome to the CDS Group's Summer of Code 2016!

### Goals
  - Learn Git usage (and GitHub)
  - Become fluent in the Python programming language
  - Understand the basics of C++ (optional)
  - Gain a practical overview of programming quantum mechanics

  
Accomplishing all of these in a single summer is an ambitious task.
It is also important to stress that this course will focus on practical aspects of quantum chemistry rather than theoretical rigor.
